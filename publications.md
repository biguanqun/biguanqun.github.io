February, 2023. [Slides](https://caihanlin.com/mypaper/slides/2023-ICAROB-Pre.pdf). -->

- [DiffusEmp: A Diffusion Model-Based Framework with Multi-Grained Control for Empathetic Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01657.pdf)<br>**Guanqun Bi**, Lei Shen, Yanan Cao, Meng Chen, Yuqiang Xie, and Xiaodong He. <br> The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (**ACL**, CCF-A, Oral), 2023.<br>
TLDR: We design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Our approach involves employing explicit multi-grained control signals to guide empathy response generation. We propose to use explicit multi-grained control signals to guide the empathy response generation. We design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, then integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process.

- [SERI: SkEtching-Reasoning-Integrating Progressive Workflow for Empathetic Response Generation]()<br>**Guanqun Bi**, Yanan Cao, Piji Li, Yuqiang Xie, Fang Fang and Zheng Lin.<br>2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (**ICASSP**, CCF-B), 2023.<br>TLDR: We propose a SkEtching-Reasoning-Integrating framework for empathetic response generation. We define an empathy planner to capture and reason about multi-source information that considers cognition and affection, and introduce a dynamic integrator module that allows the model dynamically select the appropriate information to generate empathetic responses.
