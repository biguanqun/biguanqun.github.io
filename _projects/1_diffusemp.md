## DiffusEmp: Empathetic Response Generation with Diffusion Models

This project introduces **DiffusEmp**, a novel framework based on conditional diffusion language models for generating empathetic responses in dialogue systems.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Multi-Grained Control**: Utilizes explicit control signals at multiple levels to guide response generation
- 🔄 **Diffusion-Based Generation**: Leverages the power of diffusion models for text generation
- 💬 **Empathetic Dialogue**: Focuses on generating responses that show understanding and empathy
