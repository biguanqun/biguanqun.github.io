## Dialogue & Text Generation

- [DiffusEmp: A Diffusion Model-Based Framework with Multi-Grained Control for Empathetic Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01657.pdf)<br>**Guanqun Bi**, Lei Shen, Yanan Cao, Meng Chen, Yuqiang Xie, and Xiaodong He. <br> The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (**ACL**, CCF-A, Oral), 2023.<br>Keywords: Empathetic dialogue, Diffusion Model, Controllable Text Generation<br>TLDR: We design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Our approach involves employing explicit multi-grained control signals to guide empathy response generation. We propose to use explicit multi-grained control signals to guide the empathy response generation. We design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, then integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process.

- [SERI: SkEtching-Reasoning-Integrating Progressive Workflow for Empathetic Response Generation]()<br>**Guanqun Bi**, Yanan Cao, Piji Li, Yuqiang Xie, Fang Fang and Zheng Lin.<br>2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (**ICASSP**, CCF-B), 2023.<br>Keywords: Empathetic dialogue, Commonsense Knowledge<br>TLDR: We propose a SkEtching-Reasoning-Integrating framework for empathetic response generation. We define an empathy planner to capture and reason about multi-source information that considers cognition and affection, and introduce a dynamic integrator module that allows the model dynamically select the appropriate information to generate empathetic responses.

- [COMMA: Modeling Relationship among Motivations, Emotions and Actions in Language-based Human Activities](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.15.pdf)
<br>Yuqiang Xie, Yue Hu, Wei Peng, **Guanqun Bi** and Luxi Xing.<br>the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (**COLING**, CCF-B), 2022.<br>TLDR: We propose a Cognitive Framework of Human Activity (COMMA) which can model language-based human individual activities via the relationship among needs, emotions, and actions.

- [Psychology-guided Controllable Story Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.564.pdf)
<br>Yuqiang Xie, Yue Hu, Yunpeng Li, **Guanqun Bi**, Wei Peng and Luxi Xing.<br>the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (**COLING**, CCF-B), 2022.<br>TLDR: We propose a Psychology-guIded Controllable Story Generation System (PICS) with local control and global planning, which is able to generate stories that adhere to the given leading context and desired psychological state chains for the protagonist.
