Here is **Guanqun Bi (毕冠群)**.

I am a Ph.D student majoring in Cyber Security at Insititute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Science. (Beijing, China).
I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanan Cao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~caoyanan). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree at Shandong University in Jun. 2019. 
<!-- Here is [my Resume](/file/CV-zh.pdf). -->

## Research Interests

My research interests lie within Natural Language Processing, particularly in Dialogue System and Controllable Text Generation tasks. 
I am also involved in Affective Computing, Cognitive Science and its application in Dialogue System and Text Generation.

My long-term goal is to build a controllable and explainable artificial intelligence system that establishes an emotional connection with humans and avoids generating harmful and biased information.
