Here is **Guanqun Bi (毕冠群)** 👋.

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [CoAI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in June 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanan Cao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~caoyanan).

When I'm not doing research, you can find me **birdwatching** 🐦 in parks around Beijing!

## Research Interests

My research focuses on building AI systems that truly understand and support humans:

- 🧠 **Social Intelligence** - Developing AI with human-like social understanding and interaction capabilities
- 💚 **AI for Mental Health** - Leveraging AI to support mental well-being and provide accessible care
- 🗣️ **Dialogue Systems** - Building AI that can have meaningful, empathetic conversations
- ✍️ **Controllable Text Generation** - Generating text with desired attributes and safety guarantees

My long-term goal is to build **socially intelligent AI systems** that can genuinely understand human emotions, provide meaningful support, and contribute to mental health and well-being.
